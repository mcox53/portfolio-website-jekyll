### ! Page Under Construction - 11/13/18 !

#### Employment Status: Student

I am currently still in school but am looking to begin a full time job after I graduate.

My current resume is available [HERE]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/matthew_cox_resume.pdf) but I go a little more in depth about certain things on this page.

Check out my [Github](https://github.com/mcox53) for sources to most things mentioned here. I am not able to post some things such as homework solutions or projects for classes but if you would like to see some more code, just ask me.

#### Interests

I really enjoy most aspects of electrical engineering but am particulary interested in embedded systems. I love the idea of working with software/firmware that directly interfaces and controls hardware. 

There are so many intricacies and the coolest part is that you can immediately see the results of your work. 

Having such a quick feedback loop is important to me as I have found that this is the best way for me to learn, constantly breaking and then fixing things.

Embedded systems is such a vague term but when I refer to embedded systems I am usually talking about Microcontrollers or FPGAs. These are the two classes of devices I have the most experience working with and are the ones I am focusing my learning on.

I also really enjoy the following topics within electrical engineering and especially enjoy when I can work on projects that incorporate these and embedded systems:
- Digital Signal Processing
- Digital Communication
- RF & Microwave Electronics
- Systems and Control Theory

Being so early on in my career, I haven't really decided on a certain industry but would be interested in any of the following:
- Aerospace/Defense
- Automotive
- RF/Wireless
- Consumer Electronics
- Medical Devices

Honestly, a job in any of these fields would be enjoyable for me.

#### Experience

Below are some quick blurbs about the internships I have had and other relevant experience.

##### UConn Senior Design Project - UTC Aerospace Systems

Currently partnering with UTC Aerospace Systems to design a controller for distributed sensing and control using Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus.

Even though we did not sign an NDA, I am going to refrain from talking about this more in depth until we get permission from our sponsor.

Skills: Project Management, Teamwork, ARM Microcontrollers, CAN Bus, C Programming, SPI, ADCs, Current Drivers, Motor Drivers and Voltage Regulators.

##### UTC Aerospace Systems - Space Systems
I worked here as a electronics design engineering intern during the summer after my Junior year (2018). During this internship I worked alongside the team that did the digital design for the departments product lines, including the NASA Orion project! During the summer I worked on things such as:

- Writing a module and test bench in VHDL for a simple PI controller. 
- Writing a test bench for an existing UART controller.
- Testing and analyzing digital controller characteristics in Simulink
- Developing a MATLAB based electronic parts derating tool with a fellow intern.

Skills: VHDL, MATLAB, SIMULINK, ModelSim, Libero SoC Design, teamwork, testing and verification principles and digital design principles. 

##### University of Connecticut Formula SAE
University team that participates in a [Collegiate Design Series](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events) sponsored by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Every year we build a formula style racecar and compete against over a hundred teams from around the world in Michigan.

I have been a member of the team for all four years of school but am currently on my second year of being the Electrical Lead for the team.

As the Electrical Lead I am responsible for the following:
- Design and fabrication of all the electronics on the car.
- Manage project by setting goals, deadlines, assigning tasks and maintaining project management software.
- Coming up with and working on new designs.
- Adhere to overall team goals such as reducing vehicle weight, increase reliability and performance.

If you want to check out one new R&D project I am working on for the team, check out my posts about the new Pressure Scanner Board we are designing:

- Add link eventually once tagging system is implemented :(

Skills: Project Management, PCB Design, Circuit Design, C Programming, AVR and ARM Microcontrollers, Data Acquisition principles, Testing and validation, Harness design and manufacturing, System level design and integration, CAN Bus, Automotive and ECU tuning basics.

##### Triump Engine Control Systems
This was my first internship after my Sophomore year of college (2017) and I worked as an electical design engineering intern.

During this internship I worked mostly on Analog design topics:

- Developed a lab test fixture to test DO-160 power quality standards. Designed, simulated, built and tested the board. Conducted thermal analysis under load using a FLIR camera and edited board design for better thermal management.
- Researched and tested Integrated Circuits (ICs) to replace a discrete stepper motor control circuit. Learned about stepper motors then researched and narrowed down options. Purchased and tested ICs with a stepper motor and dynamometer setup.

Skills: PCB design, PCB thermal management, PSPICE, Power switching w/ P-Channel MOSFETS, Stepper Motors, Dynamometer basics and Test procedure design.

##### Wrap up

If you want to check out other smaller projects ot learn more about a specific project I've done feel free to click on a link below or shoot me an email. I'd love to hear from you!

These links will either jump to a dedicated project page or will go to the blog section with that projects dedicated tag when the tagging system is implemented :(

I will eventually add links here :)
