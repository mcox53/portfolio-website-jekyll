#### Welcome!

My name is Matthew Cox and I am currently in my senior year majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Connecticut. My expected graduation date is May 2019. I am passionate about working with and building hardware projects but am particulary interested in embedded systems. I have experience writing code for microcontrollers as well as working with VHDL synthesized on FPGAs. These are topics I enjoy the most and have the most experience in but I also enjoy projects that include the following topics:

- Digital Signal Processing
- Digital Communication
- RF & Microwave Electronics

When not in class or working you can find me at the UConn Formula SAE shop building fast racecars, reading, or exercising.

### This Website:

I created this website as a personal portfolio site and as a way to write about the various side projects that I pursue.

The other purpose of this website is to document the independent study I plan to pursue during the Spring 2019 Semester. If you want to learn more about that, click the link below.
