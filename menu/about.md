title: About Me

#### Welcome!

My name is Matthew Cox and I am currently in my senior year majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Connecticut. I will be graduating in May 2019. I really enjoy most aspects of electrical engineering but am particulary interested in embedded systems. I have experience working with microcontrollers as well as FPGAs and I am constantly learning more. 

I have the most experience in embedded systems but I also enjoy working on or with the following:

- Digital Signal Processing
- Digital Communication
- RF & Microwave Electronics
- Systems and Control Theory

Outside of electrical engineering I am particularly interested in cars, artifical intelligence and the nature of consciousness as well as learning about and studying the human body as it relates to health and well-being.

When not in class or working you can find me reading, exercising or at the UConn Formula SAE shop building fast racecars.

### This Website:

I created this website as a personal portfolio site and as a way to write about the various side projects that I pursue.

The other purpose of this website is to document the independent study I plan to pursue during the Spring 2019 Semester. If you want to learn more about that, click the link below.

This website was built using the following tools:
- Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
- The theme is a custom implmentation of two open source, minimal themes:
	- Lagrange by [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul/).
	- Thinkspace by [Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi).
- Hosted and implemented with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
