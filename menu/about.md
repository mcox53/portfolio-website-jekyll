title: About Me

#### Welcome!

My name is Matthew Cox and I am currently in my senior year majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Connecticut. My expected graduation date is May 2019. I am passionate about working with and building hardware projects but am particulary interested in embedded systems. 

I have experience writing code for microcontrollers as well as working with VHDL synthesized on FPGAs. These are topics I have the most experience with but I also enjoy working on or with the following:

- Digital Signal Processing
- Digital Communication
- RF & Microwave Electronics

When not in class or working you can find me at the UConn Formula SAE shop building fast racecars, reading, or exercising.

### This Website:

I created this website as a personal portfolio site and as a way to write about the various side projects that I pursue.

The other purpose of this website is to document the independent study I plan to pursue during the Spring 2019 Semester. If you want to learn more about that, click the link below.

This website was built using the following tools:
- Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
- The theme is a custom implmentation of two open source, minimal themes:
	- Lagrange by [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul/).
	- Thinkspace by [Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi).
- Hosted and implemented with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

All of the code is hosted on my Github and all of the themes used are licensed under the MIT license which means the code for this site is as well.
