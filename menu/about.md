title: About Me

#### Welcome!

My name is Matthew Cox and I am currently in my senior year majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Connecticut. I will be graduating in May 2019. If you want to learn more about my work and experience please check out the [Work]({{ site.url }} /menu/work.html) page.

Outside of school, I am particularly interested in cars, artifical intelligence and the nature of consciousness as well as learning about and studying the human body as it relates to health and well-being.

When not in class or working you can find me reading, exercising or at the UConn Formula SAE shop building fast racecars.

### This Website:

I created this website as a personal portfolio site and as a way to write about the various side projects that I pursue.

The other purpose of this website is to document the independent study I plan to pursue during the Spring 2019 Semester. If you want to learn more about that, click the link below.

* Add link to Independent study tag here once tagging system is implemented :(

This website was built using the following tools:
- Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
- The theme is a custom implmentation of two open source, minimal themes:
	- Lagrange by [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul/).
	- Thinkspace by [Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi).
- Code borrowed or inspired by:
	- [Long Qian](https://longqian.me)
- Hosted and implemented with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

All of the code is hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/mcox53) and all of the themes used are licensed under the MIT license which means the code for this site is as well.
