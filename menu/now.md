title: What I'm Doing Now
---

I am currently living in Willington, CT while preparing to start my final semester at the University of Connecticut. I am beginning to prepare for my transition to the 'real world' that is post grad life.

Specifically, I am trying to figure out what I am going to do with the rest of my life, including work, hobbies and goals. 

The last four years, my entire identity and most of the things I spent time doing were based on me attending school and being a student. 

Now that this is coming to an abrupt end I am trying to figure out what to fill the enormous gap that will be left behind.

Besides that I am doing the following:
- Reading many books using Naval Ravikant's [Antifragile approach to reading](https://hackernoon.com/everything-i-knew-about-reading-was-wrong-bde7e57fbfdc).
- Conducting an independent study on electronics topics I enjoy such as microcontrollers, FPGAs and analog electronics. Read more about that [here]({{ site.url }} /tags/#independent-study).
- Dedicating time to leading and working on the UConn Formula SAE electrical team. The car is due to be finished sometime in April.
- Working on my Senior Design project for UTC Aerospace Systems. A prototype should be completed before the end of February!
- I am taking one class this semester but I guess that counts as something I am doing. So yeah, power electronics. Neat.
- Writing more. No goal in mind right now, kind of just winging it.
- Trying to run at least 10 miles a week, with the goal of working up to more.
- Lifting weights as many days of the week as possible. (Five seems to be the limit to prevent burnout)

#### These are my main priorities right now.

Everything else I will say no to. If something happens to change, I'll update this page to reflect those changes. Last update was January 13th, 2019.

*This is a Now page. It was inspired by [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/) and [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) many years ago and now that I have my own website it is finally a reality.
