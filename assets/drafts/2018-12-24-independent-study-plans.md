January is fast approaching and I have yet to post the plans I came up with for my independent study. I have been working on these on and off since I came up with the idea initially. At this point I am just going to put them out there in order to keep myself accountable going forward.

There are two plans: One for microcontrollers and one for FPGAs.

#### Method

I am going to do what I want to do, whenever I want to do it. The only goal of this endeavor is to spend time doing things I find interesting while learning at the same time. 

I made the microcontrollers plan more like a university class in the beginning while the FPGA plan is extremely open ended. This is done on purpose to see how I perform with a rigid schedule and also while completely winging it.

The between the two is that I don't have the full framework (lectures, quizzes, homework, lab, exams, etc..) that comes with a university class and the way I see it, this is a net positive. 

#### Microcontrollers

This plan has the most structure out of the two because it is a field that is very wide to begin with. I wanted to narrow down topics I was interested and find some order in the whole thing.

I wrote out a weekly schedule for January to April. At this point I will be getting busy with end of semester commitments so I didn't want to put too much on my plate.

For each week there is a general topic, listed resources to read and also lab exercises. I made a list of how each week would go ideally. 

At first, I thought it was kind of strange to be giving myself lab exercises and homework to do but I would hope that by doing the lab exercise that I would get inspired to keep working on the topic and take it even further. 

With this being said, I expect that some topics will go on for multiple weeks and not just be limited to one week. On the other hand if something is severely boring I can pivot easily. Just having the option to change course quickly is a big plus for me and I think for learning in general.

#### FPGAs

For FPGAs I plan on taking a different approach. Instead of creating a semi strict schedule as I did with MCUs, I am just going to wing it.

I already have a very capable FPGA dev board from class and all the software necessary. There is a brief list op topics but they are not hashed out in detail.

Besides this list there is no other preparing that I have done. I have my eye on two specific books but that is really it.

I am curious how this one will go without any planning at all. This could end up pretty poorly but I think its a good experiment in planning and execution.

#### Summary

Two distinct topics, 5 months, independent study, starting January. One with structure, one without. This is an exercise in life-long and independent learning which is being documented on this site and on my [Github](https://github.com/mcox53) Stay tuned for what is hopefully an interesting semester.
