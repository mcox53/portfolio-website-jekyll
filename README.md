Welcome. This is the source for my personal portfolio site. The site is built with Jekyll and deployed using Netlify.

The theme is based off of other jekyll themes I found along with some modifications I made to these free themes. The themes used are:

Lagrange by Paul Le [github](https://github.com/LeNPaul/)
Thinkspace by Heiswayi Nrird [github](https://github.com/heiswayi)

Both themes are open sourced under the MIT license.
