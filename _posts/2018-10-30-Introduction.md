This is the first post on my new portfolio site. I am working to design this website because I have a bit of free time and have wanted to do this for some time. 

With this website I plan to document projects I work on in order to maintain an online portfolio for recruiters or those who are interested in working with me.

I am also doing this in an attempt at holding myself accountable for projects that I start. Too often I have seen friends graduate from school and get too busy. They give up the things they used to love to do and the spark that used to drive them dies.

By maintaining this website, I hope to keep that curiousity and spark alive. I want this website to keep me accountable. We'll see if that happens...

In the meantime, feel free to look around. The site is still being customized at this point.

Expect to see a post or two in the coming weeks about the independent study I plan to pursue next semester. I am aiming to research and document topics as well as outline a plan soon.
