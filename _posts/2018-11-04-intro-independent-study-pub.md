#### Background

One of the main reasons behind this website is to document projects and interesting work that I do as a way for recruiters and friends to get to know me a bit better beyond just reading my resume. I think that having your own project to work on, especially in something you truly enjoy, is very fulfilling and by writing about them here I can share it with the rest of the world.

The idea for this website came about in middle of this semester as I was starting to plan out courses for my final semester of my college. I checked through all of the requirements and realized I only had one class left to take in order to graduate besides credits related to my senior design project.

I immediately began thinking about what I should do to fill up my schedule. With only two classes, I would be a part time student. I thought about taking some random general education classes or some more electrical engineering electives but I really wanted to just dive deep into some topics in my field.

I finally decided to do two independent studies so that I would be full time and could work on topics that I was interested in. Plus I would have the help of two very smart professsors if needed. Sounds great right? 

I wrote up two documents outlining topics in Microcontrollers (MCUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that I would study. 

Some of these topics I researched and others I noticed during the two internships I had. I chose these topics based on a few criteria:

- Is this relevant in the industry?
- Will this exercise and improve foundational skills in this field?
- Is the level of difficulty reasonable?
	- Would I be out of my league?
	- Would the chosen topic advance my knowledge and overall problem solving abilities?
- Is this something I am interested in?

After I completed the lists I went to two professors to propose the studies. I am already taking an independent study with one of these professors in MCUs and the other teaches the hardware lab for FPGAs.

I pitched the ideas to both of them and was disappointed with the results. Both of them liked the fact that I wanted to study these topics but both of them kind of referred me to their grad students to do work with them instead.

This was a big letdown for me as I really don't want to do research at this point. I feel like I don't have enough knowledge to be able to contribute to their research which is exactly why I wanted to do the independent study in the first place.

The way tuition works at my school is that when you are part time you pay by credit and full time you pay a flat rate. There was just no way I was going to pay money to do research for someone else when I could save almost half of my tuition and do whatever I wanted instead. 

At this point I just decided to go part time instead but still study the list of topics I came up with.

#### Motivation

Throughout college I have always wanted to take on some interesting projects on the side that involved learning about a specific topic and then creating or building something that appealed to my interests. 

I always had plenty of ideas but no time to do them. Looking back many of the ideas were over my head and I was completely prioritizing the wrong things at the time. If I had truly wanted to work on some projects, I definitely could have. Its not like I wasn't busy or anything but I just didn't put in the effort. 

I'm not going to lie, I also used to have this problem where I lost any motivation to work on something if it didn't have a due date for school or if someone wasn't depending on me to get it done. It could have been the most interesting thing in the world but after all the other work was finished my motivation dropped to zero. I am sure I am not the only person in the world who has had this problem but it is definitely tough to get over.

Fast forward a couple of years to now, I think my motivation and focus has improved to a point where I can pick out reasonable projects that I want to work on and see them to completion.

The following list is a set of academic goals I hope to accomplish during the semester:
- Prove to myself that I can see a major undertaking like this from concept to completion.
- Improve self-learning skills. If there is no one to teach me how do I go about reaching a level of competence in the desired topic?
- Set myself up for lifelong learning. If I can do projects like this or really anything on my own, what's stopping me from doing this the rest of my life?
- Gain some relevant experience.
- Go beyond the basic skills taught in class.
- Do some interesting things :)

I am sure I will come up with a list of other things I want to do besides study all day and I may or may not post that here.

So there you have it. In the coming weeks I will write more about the plan for next semester as I draft up a formal schedule.

Thanks for reading!
