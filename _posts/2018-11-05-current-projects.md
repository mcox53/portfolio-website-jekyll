Since next semester is still pretty far off and I wanted to get this blog moving I decided that I am going to make some posts this semester about the projects I am working on. Hopefully I will get into the habit of documenting everything now so next semester it will be a bit easier to do.

I don't have too much going on because I am taking 18 credits but there are stil some interesting things that I am working on right now.


#### UConn FSAE Pressure Scanner Board

This project is for the University of Connecticut Formula SAE team. The main idea of the project is to create a PCB and enclosure to locally test differential and static pressure while the car is driving. 

The team is currently developing an aerodynamic package and the ability to test and validate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with actual pressure measurements is very desirable.

The design of the board is just starting and I will probably make some posts about it as it progresses. This project isn't very complex and should be completed by the end of the year.

#### Senior Design Project: Networked CAN Bus Controllers

This project is my senior design project. This is a project that is assigned in the beginning of senior year and is worked on for the entire year culminating with a demo day the week before graduation.

Students fill out a survey highlighting their skills and then choose 3 projects from the list. The Senior Design Committee will then try to evenly match students to a project by skill level and preference. The projects are sponsored mostly by local companies and students work with the companies along with a faculty advisor throughout the year. 

The project I am working on is sponsored by UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS). The goal of the project is to conduct design and build a controller for distributed sensing and control using the Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus.

At this point design is well under way. However, I am not sure how much I can talk about this and I definitely am weary of posting code to my github. I may just post high level updates if anything. It is quite an interesting project but I do not want to cross any lines.

#### Advanced Microcontrollers Course

I am currently (Fall 2018) enrolled in a class that covers Advanced Microcontroller (MCU) topics. This course was not being offered this semester but there were 3 of us who really wanted to take it. We met with the professor and he is allowing us to take it as an independent study. There are no lectures or meeting times but we do occaisonally meet up to collaborate on labs.

Topics include: Bluetooth, CAN bus, SRAM, OLED and Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS). We are utilizing the ATmega328p and are using Atmel Studio to program it.

I am already mostly through the labs but there is a final project that involves controlling a collision avoiding robot over bluetooth. This is a group effort and has yet to begin. I will probably write something about this.

#### Driver Communication Module

This is another project for the University of Connecticut Formula SAE Team. The main idea behind this project is to quickly design a hands-free two way radio for communicating with the driver while they are in the car. 

This project has been briefly mentioned but is more just a thought at this point. The issue with using walkie talkie's at competition is that everyone uses them, there is very little privacy available and I'm sure there is the possibility of channel crowding. There is also the problem of the driver having to press a button to talk which is the last thing we want them to be doing while while racing.

If this project was to move forward, we would utilize the open 900 MHz spectrum in the UHF band. Again, we are not even too sure if this is reasonably possible to do for cheap but it would be a nice design project for a newer member and a more experienced team member to work together on.

#### Conclusion

I believe that this is enough to keep me busy for the rest of the semester and during winter break as well. There will be a few posts coming within the next week or so outlining the projects a bit more in depth. Following that I will jump right into posting about the research and design I am doing for each project. Expect those posts to be pretty detailed.

Thanks for reading!
